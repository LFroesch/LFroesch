- 👋 Hi, I’m @LFroesch
- 👀 I’m interested in ... learning and making fun projects
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... through boot.dev
- ⚒️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... games, mobile apps (in the future), and a startup!
- 📫 How to reach me ... 
- ⚡ Fun fact: ... I used to be a raid leader for a 6,000 member Discord in WoW as well as a Event Planner/Booking Manager for multiple music venues
- 🖥️ Yet I'd much prefer to sit and code alone with my dog :)
